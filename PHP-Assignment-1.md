## Assignment
We want you to write clean and standards compliant PHP to save user information captured from a form into a database, then retrieve and show  all records in a list.

The following fields are needed  - Name, Country, Email, Mobile Number, About You, Birthday
 
There should be a form page to add data, and a paginated list page to view the data. It should also be possible to edit the data for an existing user. 

You may use any CSS or Javascript frameworks like bootstrap or jQuery to make the pages look nice and easy to use. The PHP, CSS & JavaScript should follow all best coding practices. We recommend that you make maximum use of HTML & CSS techniques for UI. The form must be properly validated using jQuery.
